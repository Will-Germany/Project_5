# Project_5
Plan for Project_5:
Step 1: Create a new stat named "Charisma" in Entity
Step 2: Implement a new class for characters; class name will be: "Warlock"
Step 3: Implement the skills for Warlock; as of this moment the thought    process is to create a magic based skill "Eldritch Blast" similar to the   Mage's spell attacks however this will use the new stat called Charisma as the base.
Step 4: Implement another new skill named "Rapier" or one named "Hand-Crossbow" both of these would use agility, I'm unsure which one I want at the moment, or if I'll create both.
Step 5: Implement a final skill called "Sacred Flame" this will be an ability check of sorts where the target will have a random dice roll added on to their agility stat that will have to beat a skillscore of the users Charisma plus a static number, where if the target passes they recieve no damage, otherwise they will take damage based off of the users charisma stat.
