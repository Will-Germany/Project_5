# Project_5
Plan for Project_5:
Step 1: Create a new stat named "Charisma" in Entity
Step 2: Implement a new class for characters; class name will be: "Warlock"
Step 3: Implement the skills for Warlock; as of this moment the thought process is to create a magic based skill "Eldritch Blast" similar to the Mage's spell attacks however this will use the new stat called Charisma as the base.
Step 4: Implement another new skill named "Hand-Crossbow" this will use agility.
Step 5: Implement a final skill called "Sacred Flame" this will run a random number generator, where on a succesful number roll, the target will avoid the Warlock's attack
